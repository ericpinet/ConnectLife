  Introduction
  ------------
  This sample Java application shows how to set and get parameters of a local 
  or remote XBee device. This method is intended to be used when you need to 
  set or get the value of a parameter that does not have its own getter and 
  setter within the XBee device object.
  
  The application sets the value of four parameters with different value types: 
  string, byte array and integer. Then it reads them from the device to verify 
  that the read values are the same as the values that were set.
  
  NOTE: This example uses the generic XBee device (XBeeDevice) class, but it 
        can be applied to any other local or remote XBee device class.

    * com.digi.xbee.api.getsetparameters.MainApp.java:
      Main application class. It instantiates an XBee device, establishes a 
      serial connection with it and sets and gets 4 different parameters. 
      Finally it compares the value of the read parameters with the values 
      that were set printing out the result.


  Requirements
  ------------
  To run this example you will need:
  
    * One XBee radio in API mode and its corresponding carrier board (XBIB 
      or XBee Development Board).
    * The XCTU application (available at www.digi.com/xctu).


  Example setup
  -------------
    1) Plug the XBee radio into the XBee adapter and connect it to your
       computer's USB or serial port.
       
    2) Ensure that the module is in API mode.
       For further information on how to perform this task, read the 
       'Configuring Your XBee Modules' topic of the Getting Started guide.
       
    3) Set the port and baud rate of the XBee radio in the MainApp class.
       If you configured the module in the previous step with the XCTU, you 
       will see the port number and baud rate in the 'Port' label of the device 
       on the left view.


  Running the example
  -------------------
  First, build and launch the application. To test the functionality, check 
  that the output console states the following message: 
  
    "All parameters were set correctly!".
    
  That message indicates that all the parameters could be set and their read 
  values are the same as the values that were set.
