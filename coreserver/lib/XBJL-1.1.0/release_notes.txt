Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This document provides the latest release information for the XBee Java 
Library, which allows customers to easily develop Java applications 
that communicate with XBee modules.


 XBee Java Library v1.1.0, May 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Changes with respect to previous version:
     * Added support for explicit frames and application layer fields 
       (Source endpoint, Destination endpoint, Profile ID, and Cluster ID).
     * Added five examples that demonstrate the new functionality of the API:
        * Receive explicit data example.
        * Receive explicit data polling example.
        * Send explicit data example.
        * Send explicit data asynchronously example.
        * Send broadcast explicit data example.
     * Minor cosmetic bug fixes.

 XBee Java Library v1.0.1, December 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Changes with respect to previous version:
    * Included RxTx 2.2 libraries. This allows the use of the library in Linux 
      on 64 bit JVM.
    * Added third party license agreements to the README.md file.
    * Minor cosmetic bug fixes.

      * XBee-PRO DigiMesh 2.4
      * XBee-PRO 868
      * XBee 865LP
      * XBee 868LP

2. Changes with respect to previous version:
    * Library features:
      * Support for API and API Escaped operating modes. Application 
        Transparent (AT) operating mode is not supported by the library.
      * Management of local (attached to the PC) and remote XBee device objects.
      * Discovery of remote XBee devices that are associated to the same 
        network as the local one.
      * Configuration of local and remote XBee devices:
        * Configure common parameters with specific setters and getters.
        * Configure any other parameter with generic methods.
        * Execute AT commands.
        * Apply configuration changes.
        * Write configuration changes.
        * Reset the device.
      * Transmission of data to all the XBee devices of the network or to a 
        specific one.
      * Reception of data from remote XBee devices:
        * Data polling.
        * Data reception callback.
      * Reception of network status changes related to the local XBee device.
      * IO lines management:
        * Configure IO lines
        * Set IO line value.
        * Read IO line value.
        * Receive IO data samples from any remote XBee device of the network.
     
   * Set of examples demonstrating the functionality of the API.
     * Communication:
        * Receive data example.
        * Receive data polling example.
        * Receive data Modem Status example.
        * Send data example.
        * Send asynchronous data example.
        * Send broadcast data example.
     * Configuration:
        * Manage common parameters example.
        * Reset the module example.
        * Set and get parameters example.
     * IO:
        * IO sampling example.
        * Local ADC example.
        * Local DIO example.
        * Remote ADC example.
        * Remote DIO example.
     * Network:
        * Discover devices example.
     
   * Comprehensive online documentation including:
     * Getting Started Guide.
     * Users Guide.
     * API Reference Manual.

3. Known issues and limitations:
    * Serial ports cannot be found by the RxTx library in Linux machines 
      running a 64-bit JVM.
